# Wikipedia Airline Crash Scraper & Kaggle Publisher

## Project Goal

This project was undertaken primarily as an exercise to learn and practice web scraping techniques using Python. The goal was **not** to create a definitive or highly accurate dataset, but rather to go through the process of:

1.  Identifying and extracting structured data (tables) from a web page (Wikipedia).
2.  Fetching supplementary data from other online sources.
3.  Cleaning and merging data from different sources.
4.  Publishing the resulting dataset to a platform like Kaggle.

## Description

This repository contains Python scripts that:

1.  Scrape data about airline accidents and incidents from a specific Wikipedia page (e.g., "List of accidents and incidents involving commercial aircraft").
2.  Gather related information from other unspecified web data sources.
3.  Merge and perform basic cleaning on the collected data using libraries like Pandas.
4.  Output the final dataset, intended for publication on Kaggle.

## Data Sources

* **Primary:** Wikipedia article listing commercial aircraft accidents.
* **Secondary:** Various other web pages (details not specified in this project scope).

## Output

* A consolidated dataset (e.g., CSV file) containing merged information about airline crashes.
* This dataset is intended to be uploaded to Kaggle. (You can add a link here if you've published it).
    * **Kaggle Dataset Link:** [Link to your Kaggle dataset - if available]

## Tech Stack (Example)

* Python 3.x
* `requests` (for fetching web pages)
* `beautifulsoup4` (for parsing HTML)
* `pandas` (for data manipulation and cleaning)
* (Add `kaggle` API library if used for direct publishing)

## Disclaimer

* The data scraped from Wikipedia and other web sources may contain inaccuracies, omissions, or biases.
* This project and its output are for educational and demonstration purposes only.
* **Do not** rely on this data for serious analysis or decision-making without verifying it against official aviation safety reports and databases.
